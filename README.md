# Shogun 2 Unit Possession

Take control of a soldier in **Total War: SHOGUN 2**, fight in first or third person, and command your unit while the battle continues around you. Select a friendly unit and press **F9** to enter possession. Press **F10** or **Escape** to return to your RTS camera.

**For single-player land battles and sieges.** Naval possession and multiplayer are not implemented. Visual bugs, gameplay bugs and occasional crashes remain.

## Features

- **First- and third-person play:** start in third person, switch with **P**, adjust camera distance, or orbit your soldier.
- **Soldier selection:** at the closest RTS zoom, point at a soldier in your selected unit and press **F9**. Generals, officers, flag bearers and musicians use their own equipment. From further away, the mod picks a soldier for you.
- **Ranged combat:** aim and fire bows, guns and thrown weapons. Hold and release bow shots to vary their strength. Unit accuracy affects shot spread; sights help you allow for projectile drop.
- **Melee combat:** time the displayed mouse-button prompts during the game's combat animations. Running toward an enemy can start a charge, although charging is unreliable.
- **Unit commands:** issue move and attack orders, drag formations, stop, hold position, follow, and choose fire orders. The game's formations, pathfinding, morale and fatigue still apply.
- **Abilities and ammunition:** select the options available to your unit, including targeted friendly abilities such as Inspire, subject to the game's restrictions and cooldowns.
- **Cavalry and sieges:** ride cavalry, order supported units to mount or dismount, and attempt castle-wall climbing. Climbing is intermittent.
- **Possession HUD:** see unit condition, weapon, ammunition, abilities and orders. **K** hides the ordinary HUD while keeping melee timing prompts visible. Direct hits on allies from your tracked shots can trigger the “Shameful display!” voice.

## Download

**Current release: v0.32.** [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3825625050) is the normal installation route.

The [v0.32 GitHub release](https://github.com/logsam58/shogun2-unit-possession/releases/tag/v0.32) also contains:

| Download | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Shogun2-Unit-Possession-v0.32-Workshop.zip` | Archive of the Workshop pack, player instructions and license notices |
| `Shogun2-Unit-Possession-v0.32-Source.zip` | Source code and build instructions; not a ready-to-play installation |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` / `release-manifest.json` | Download checksums and build identification |

Workshop subscribers do not need a separate GitHub download. Access to the Workshop item and repository is controlled by the owner.

## Requirements

- An owned installation of the **original Windows Steam version of Total War: SHOGUN 2**, using the supported game build.
- The installed game's `data.pack` and English `local_en.pack`, used to prepare artwork, fonts and the advisor voice.
- **Windows N editions:** the Media Feature Pack.

No compiler or Python installation is needed to play. The mod prepares its resources from your installed game on first launch and caches them for reuse; those resources are not bundled in the download.

</details>

## Installation

1. Close the game. If you used an older setup.exe release, follow the upgrade instructions below first.
2. [Subscribe to Shogun 2 Unit Possession on Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3825625050).
3. Enable **Shogun 2 Unit Possession** in the launcher and start the game through Steam.
4. In a single-player land battle or siege, select a living friendly unit and press **F9**.
5. Possession starts in **third person**. Press **P** for first person; **F10** or **Escape** returns to RTS control.

The Workshop version needs no setup program, external script, camera chooser or Steam launch-option edit. **Restart the game after enabling, disabling or updating the mod.**

### Upgrading from an older setup.exe release

Close the game, uninstall the older version, and remove its old camera-helper Steam launch option before enabling Workshop. Do not run the older DInput mod loader alongside the Workshop version.

### Disabling or uninstalling

**F12** disables the mod until the game restarts. To stop loading it on future launches, close the game and disable it in the launcher or unsubscribe from the Workshop item.

Local resource caches and rollback backups may remain. Do not delete unfamiliar files blindly.

## Controls

These controls apply during possession unless stated otherwise. **LMB** means left mouse button; **RMB** means right mouse button.

### Your soldier and camera

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **F9** | Possess a soldier in the selected unit; at closest RTS zoom, point the mouse cursor at who you want |
| **F10 / Escape** | Return to your previous RTS camera |
| **WASD** | Move |
| **Shift** | Run; hold **W + Shift** toward an enemy to attempt a charge |
| **Mouse** | Look around |
| **P** | Switch first/third person |
| **Mouse wheel** in third person | Move the camera closer or further away |
| **Hold middle mouse** in third person | Orbit your soldier while keeping your movement direction |
| **M** | Order the unit to mount/dismount, where supported |
| **Hold RMB** | Ready your ranged weapon |
| **LMB** | Fire guns or thrown weapons; hold and release for bow draw strength |
| **1** | Toggle the whole unit's native melee/ranged mode, where supported |
| **T / G** | Select an ability or special ammunition / use or end it; aim at friendlies for targeted abilities |
| **Hold Ctrl** | Crouch to fire, where supported |
| **Shown LMB / RMB prompt** | Click the indicated button as the marker reaches the highlighted zone |
| **F** near a wall | Begin climbing |
| **W / S** while climbing | Climb up / down; release both to hold position |
| **K** | Hide/show the RTS and possession HUD; melee prompts remain visible |
| **F12** | Disable the mod until the game restarts |

### Your unit

| Key | Order |
| --- | --- |
| **Q — Move / Attack** | Point at the ground to move, or an enemy or supported breakable target to attack. Tap to walk; double-tap to run or charge. Hold Q and drag left to right to set the formation, then release. |
| **E — Stop** | Stop the unit. |
| **Z — Hold Here** | Form up at your current position, facing the direction you're looking when you press Z. Tap to walk there; double-tap to run. |
| **C — Follow Me** | Form up beside you. Run to catch up when needed, then match your pace. When you stop, your men finish forming up around you. |
| **R — Fire orders** | Cycle **Hold Fire → Fire at Will → Fire on Command**. Fire on Command tells the unit to fire when you fire. |

Unit orders are unavailable while you're locked in a melee animation, climbing or landing.

## Compatibility

| Game mode or mod | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Single-player land battles and sieges | Intended use; bugs and crashes remain |
| Shogun 2, Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai weapons | Recognised, but not every unit, weapon or ammunition combination has been tested |
| Artillery | Uses the game's existing first-person mode |
| Naval battles | Possession and ship commands are not available |
| Multiplayer, Versus and campaign drop-in | Not implemented |
| Overhaul mods | Compatibility unconfirmed |
| Mods replacing the front-end root script entry | Compatibility untested; the Workshop version replaces this same entry |
| Older DInput installation of this mod | Do not combine with Workshop |

## Known limitations

- **Crashes remain unresolved**, including crashes with blood turned off.
- **Large battles can slow down severely**, especially with Ultra unit size, several armies or dense fighting. Lower graphics settings do not necessarily prevent this.
- **Charging and castle-wall climbing are unreliable:** either may work on one attempt and fail on another.
- **First-person arms and weapons can clip.** Mounted bows also have presentation problems.
- **Bow draw sound follows the native animation**, which begins with RMB, rather than the variable LMB draw input.
- **Enemy targeting of a player separated from their formation is not fully verified.**
- Not every unit, ability, castle layout or display configuration has been tested.

See [known issues and reporting details](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for additional combat, camera and targeting limitations.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| **F9 does nothing** | Select a living friendly unit in a single-player land battle or siege. Check that the mod is enabled, restart after enabling/updating, and confirm you have the supported Windows Steam game build. |
| **HUD or resources fail to load** | Check that `data.pack` and English `local_en.pack` are present. Windows N needs the Media Feature Pack. Changed or unfamiliar cache files can stop initialization and are preserved; do not delete them blindly. |
| **Problems after upgrading** | Check that the older setup.exe version is uninstalled and its camera-helper launch option removed. Do not run both loaders. |
| **Shots or volleys do not fire** | Note the exact unit, weapon and ammunition, and whether the problem affects your soldier, the rest of the unit, or both. Not all combinations have been tested. |
| **Missing HUD or unusual timing** | Report resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode, Windows scaling, monitor refresh rate, battle speed and whether the whole game slowed down. |
| **Crashes or severe slowdown** | Report the map, unit size, army count and nearby fighting. Leaving and re-entering possession is not a confirmed fix. |

To [report a problem](https://github.com/logsam58/shogun2-unit-possession/issues), include the mod version, game/expansion, battle type, map, unit, weapon, ammunition, other mods, and what you did before the problem occurred. Add graphics settings for visual issues and any error message for crashes.
