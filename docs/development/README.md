# Development history

This directory preserves the chronological Test and Diagnostics notebooks and
their validation receipts. It is historical evidence, not a setup guide or a
list of outstanding tasks. Version claims, local paths and readiness requests
describe the session in which each note was written.

Start new work with the [developer guide](../README.md), [current release identity](../current-release.json),
and [validation summary](../../VALIDATION.md). Product v0.32 uses Test166; its
Workshop design and receipts are in `docs/public-release`, not a new `Test166.md`
in this directory.

| Records | Subject |
| --- | --- |
| `Checkpoint2`–`Checkpoint4` | Early implementation checkpoints |
| `Test100`–`Test109` | Orders, presentation, animation, context and friendly-fire work |
| `Diagnostics110`–`Diagnostics112` | External recorder, startup recovery and diagnostic hardening |
| `Test113`–`Test124` | QTE input, crowd admission, participant identity and preparation |
| `Test125`–`Test144` | Possession, movement, combat, equipment and ability work |
| `Test146`–`Test157` | Charge, HUD, camera/lifetime and final-human role work |

Numbers are historical identifiers; gaps do not imply missing required build
inputs. Read each note alongside its available `*-validation.json` receipt and
the relevant source regression tests. A proposed check in a notebook is not
evidence that it ran.

The full notebooks are kept in the [repository history directory](https://github.com/logsam58/shogun2-unit-possession/tree/main/docs/development)
and omitted from the curated source ZIP. Do not execute historical install,
deployment, capture or publication commands as part of routine development.
